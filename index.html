      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>John Backus's parents were Cecil Franklin Backus and Elizabeth Warner Edsall. Cecil
        Backus graduated with a degree in chemistry from the University of Virginia in 1906 and worked for the Eastern
        Laboratory of the E I Dupont De Nemours Powder Company before moving to work for the Atlas Powder Company in
        Wilmington, Delaware. He worked for the investment banking firm of Gillespie & Meeds from 1920 to 1922. This
        firm became Laird, Bissell & Meeds and he was a partner from 1923 to 1940. Elizabeth Edsall, John's mother, was
        the daughter of+ a Wilmington physician. Cecil and Elizabeth were married on 28 May 1921 in Wilmington, New
        Castle, Delaware. They had three children, Anne Hall Backus (born 25 March 1922), John Warner Backus (the
        subject of this biography) and Cecil Franklin Backus Jr. The family were well off and during the years that
        Cecil and Elizabeth Backus were married they collected high quality American antique furniture. After John's
        mother Elizabeth died, his father married Alice Beaver Candee (1901-1992) on 12 June 1935 in Wilmington, New
        Castle, Delaware. John spent his first years in Wilmington, Delaware and then attended the Hill School in
        Pottstown, Pennsylvania. This family boarding school, founded in 1851, was highly regarded and run by the
        headmaster James I Wendell. Backus graduated from the Hill School in 1942 although, according to his own
        account, he did not take his studies there too seriously.</p>

      <h2>Creation of FORTRAN</h2>
      <p>FORTRAN is one of the first computer programming languages. It was created in 1957 by John Backus as a scientific mathmatical language, his inventon shortened the process of programming
        and made computer programming more accessible for people but mainly scientists. The creation of FORTRAN, which debuted in 1957, marked a
        significant stage in the development of computer programming languages.</p>
